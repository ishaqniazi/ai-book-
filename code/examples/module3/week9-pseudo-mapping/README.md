# Pseudo Mapping Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates basic concepts of environmental mapping for robotics. It simulates how a robot can build a map of its environment using sensor data, representing space in different ways for navigation and understanding.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Occupancy grid mapping (probabilistic representation)
- Feature-based mapping (landmark identification)
- Topological mapping (waypoint and path planning)
- Multi-representation mapping approaches
