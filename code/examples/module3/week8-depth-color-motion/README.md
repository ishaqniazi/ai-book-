# Perception Pipeline: Depth, Color, and Motion Analysis Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates concepts of visual perception in robotics, specifically how robots process depth, color, and motion information from their visual sensors to understand and interact with their environment.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Depth processing and 3D understanding
- Color processing for object recognition
- Motion analysis using optical flow
- Multi-modal perception fusion
