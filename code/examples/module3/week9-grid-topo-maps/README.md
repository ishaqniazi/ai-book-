# Grid and Topological Mapping Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates concepts of grid-based and topological mapping for robotics. It shows how robots can represent their environment using both metric (grid) and topological (waypoint-based) approaches for navigation and spatial understanding.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Grid mapping with occupancy probabilities
- Topological mapping with waypoints and connections
- Feature extraction from grid maps
- Path planning in both representations
