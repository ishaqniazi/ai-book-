# Frame Analysis Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates basic concepts of frame analysis in vision systems. It simulates how a robot can analyze video frames to detect objects, track movement, and understand the visual scene for robotics applications.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Feature detection (corners, edges, blobs, etc.)
- Motion analysis between frames
- Object tracking across frames
- Scene understanding and composition analysis

## Files
- `frame_analysis.py`: Main implementation of frame analysis
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `test.sh`: Test script to verify functionality
