# Rule-Based Navigation Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates concepts of rule-based navigation systems for robots. It simulates how a robot can navigate its environment using predefined rules and reactive behaviors rather than complex path planning algorithms.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Rule-based decision making
- Reactive navigation behaviors
- Sensor data processing for navigation
- Obstacle avoidance and path correction
