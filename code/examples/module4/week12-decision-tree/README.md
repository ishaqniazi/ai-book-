# Decision Tree for Robot Decision Making Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates concepts of decision trees applied to robot decision-making. It simulates how a robot can use decision trees to make choices based on sensor input and environmental conditions.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Decision tree structure and traversal
- Sensor data processing for decision making
- Conditional logic in robot behavior
- Tree-based decision systems
