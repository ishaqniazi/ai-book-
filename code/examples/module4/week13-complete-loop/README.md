# Complete System Loop Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates a complete physical AI system loop that integrates all the concepts learned throughout the course: sensing, perception, decision-making, and action. It simulates a robot performing a complete task cycle.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Complete sensor-perception-decision-action loop
- Integration of multiple AI concepts
- Environmental modeling and object detection
- Task execution and state management
