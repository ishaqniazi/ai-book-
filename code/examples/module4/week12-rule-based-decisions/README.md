# Rule-Based Robot Decision Making Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates concepts of rule-based systems for robot decision-making. It simulates how a robot can make decisions based on predefined rules and conditions derived from sensor data and environmental context.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Rule-based decision systems
- Conditional logic evaluation
- Priority-based rule selection
- Sensor data processing for decision making
