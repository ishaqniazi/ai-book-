# Forward and Inverse Kinematics Simulation Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates concepts of forward and inverse kinematics for robotic arms. It simulates how a robot calculates where its end effector will be based on joint angles (forward kinematics) and how it determines joint angles needed to reach a specific position (inverse kinematics).

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Forward kinematics: joint angles to end effector position
- Inverse kinematics: end effector position to joint angles
- Workspace analysis and reachability
- Joint limits and constraints
