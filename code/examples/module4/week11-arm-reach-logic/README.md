# Arm Reach Logic Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates concepts of robotic arm reach logic and kinematics. It simulates how a robot arm determines if it can reach a target position and calculates the necessary joint angles to achieve the reach.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Reachability analysis considering arm kinematics
- Obstacle detection in the path
- Simplified inverse kinematics for joint angle calculation
- Workspace analysis and joint limits
