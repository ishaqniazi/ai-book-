# Embodiment Concepts Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates the core principles of embodiment in Physical AI systems. It illustrates how digital intelligence can be connected to physical systems through a simple simulation of a sensing-thinking-acting loop.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Digital Brain → Physical Body paradigm
- Basic sensing and perception
- Simple decision-making
- Physical action execution
- Feedback loop implementation
