# Balance Logic Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates basic balance control concepts that are fundamental to physical systems. It shows how a system can maintain stability through sensor feedback and control actions, simulating the principles of balance in physical AI systems.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Feedback control for stability
- Center of mass management
- Sensor-based balance correction
- Proportional control principles
- Stability maintenance in dynamic conditions
