# Digital World Mapping Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates how a Physical AI system might create and maintain a digital representation of its physical environment. It simulates the mapping process that connects physical space to digital models.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Environment mapping and representation
- Spatial relationship tracking
- Digital-physical world alignment
- Map updating and maintenance
- Localization in mapped environments

## Files
- `digital_mapper.py`: Main implementation of digital world mapping logic
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `test.sh`: Test script to verify functionality
