# Sensor Loop Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates basic sensor processing and the continuous sensing loop that is fundamental to Physical AI systems. It shows how a system can continuously gather, process, and respond to sensor data in real-time.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Continuous sensor data acquisition
- Real-time processing of sensor data
- Basic sensor fusion concepts
- Response to environmental changes
- Timing and synchronization considerations
