# Object Recognition Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates basic object recognition concepts in Physical AI systems. It simulates how a system might identify and classify objects in its environment using simple feature extraction and matching techniques.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Feature extraction from sensor data
- Basic pattern recognition
- Object classification
- Confidence estimation
- Recognition in noisy conditions
