# Contact and Friction Simulation Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates basic principles of contact mechanics and friction in physical AI systems. It simulates how objects interact when they come into contact with surfaces and how friction affects their motion, which is crucial for understanding physical interaction in robotics.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Contact mechanics between objects and surfaces
- Static and kinetic friction
- Normal forces and restitution (bounciness)
- Collision detection and response
