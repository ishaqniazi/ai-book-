# Gesture Basics Simulation Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates basic gesture recognition and generation concepts in human-robot interaction. It simulates how a robot can recognize human gestures and generate appropriate response gestures, which is fundamental for natural human-robot communication.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Gesture recognition from joint position data
- Gesture sequence matching and similarity calculation
- Appropriate gesture response generation
- Human-robot gesture interaction protocols

- `gesture_simulation.py`: Main implementation of gesture recognition and generation
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `test.sh`: Test script to verify functionality
