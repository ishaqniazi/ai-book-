# Attention and Intention Simulation Example

## Description
This conceptual example demonstrates principles of attention and intention in human-robot interaction. It simulates how a robot can focus its attention on relevant stimuli and form intentions based on its observations and goals, which is essential for meaningful interaction.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Attention allocation mechanisms (selective, divided, sustained, alerting)
- Intention formation from sensory input
- Context-aware behavior planning
- Stimulus processing and prioritization
