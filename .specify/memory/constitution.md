# AI Textbook Constitution
<!-- Constitution for Digital Brain → Physical Body (Embodied Intelligence) textbook project -->

## Core Principles

### I. Project Theme & Purpose
**Digital Brain → Physical Body (Embodied Intelligence)** - Build a full Docusaurus textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics using Claude Code, SpecKit Plus, and Docusaurus. Automation must create missing files/folders automatically. Deliverables include a public GitHub repo and a live Docusaurus book. Execution is restricted to textbook content creation and AI-powered educational enhancement features - no hardware installation steps, or automation for ROS, robots, or sensors unless explicitly defined in /specs/features/.

### II. Communication & Language Standards
All code, documentation, and technical terms must be in English. File and folder names use English (kebab-case). User-facing responses must be in Roman Urdu. ALL code comments must be in English, with consistent terminology throughout the project.

### III. Project Organization Standards
Organize by feature/module, not filetype. Maximum 3–4 nesting levels. Keep root clean (configs only). Related files stay together. Maintain folder hygiene by deleting unused files and using `.gitignore`. Keep source code, documentation, and configuration separate. Specs go to root or `/specs`, textbook content to `/docs`, and README must always be updated.

### IV. Auto-Create Rules (Claude Code + SpecKit Plus)
Auto-generate missing files using the header format: `# <file-name>` with the comment `<!-- Auto-generated by Claude Code (SpecKit Plus Rule) -->`. Auto-create missing folders and log: `"Auto-created: <folder>"`. For feature directory repair: detect missing files, create placeholders, continue execution. All auto-generated files must contain a header, auto-gen rule comment, and a TODO checklist.

### V. Course Structure & Content Requirements
The 13-week course is structured as: Module 1 — ROS 2 Nervous System (Weeks 1–5), Module 2 — Digital Twin (Weeks 6–7), Module 3 — NVIDIA Isaac AI Brain (Weeks 8–10), Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action (Weeks 11–13). Total content: 15,000–20,000 words (Module 1: 4k–5k, Module 2: 3.5k–4.5k, Module 3: 4k–5k, Module 4: 3.5k–4.5k). Minimum 5 examples per module, Ubuntu 22.04 compatible, with type hints, English comments, and error handling. Each module must include 3 diagrams (total 12). All content in Docusaurus Markdown format with required frontmatter.

### VI. Technical Standards & Hardware Documentation
Technical standards: OS Ubuntu 22.04, ROS 2 Humble/Iron, testing in clean environment, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Hardware documentation includes Digital Twin Workstation (RTX 4070 Ti+, 64GB RAM, Ubuntu 22.04), Edge AI Kit (Jetson Orin Nano, RealSense D435i, ReSpeaker Mic, IMU module), Robot Lab Options (Go2, G1/OP3/TonyPi, premium humanoid), and Cloud Alternative (AWS g5.2xlarge, NVIDIA A10G).

## Additional Constraints

### Course Module Requirements
Each module must follow the specified week structure with appropriate content depth. Module 1 covers ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, URDF humanoid models, rclpy, and sensor pipelines. Module 2 covers Gazebo physics, Unity visualization, and multi-sensor simulation. Module 3 covers Isaac Sim, Nav2, VSLAM, and Isaac ROS. Module 4 covers Whisper to intent, LLM planning, VLA pipeline, and capstone humanoid project.

### Content Format Standards
All documentation must follow Docusaurus Markdown format with proper frontmatter. Each module must include 3 diagrams for visual explanation. Code examples must be Ubuntu 22.04 compatible with type hints and English comments. All content must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant for accessibility.

## Development Workflow

### Implementation Process
Use Claude Code and SpecKit Plus for automated content creation. Follow the 13-week module structure with appropriate word counts per module. Create at minimum 5 code examples per module with proper error handling. Include 3 diagrams per module for visual learning support. Ensure all code examples are tested in clean Ubuntu 22.04 environment.

### Quality Assurance
All content must be reviewed for technical accuracy and accessibility compliance. Code examples must be tested in the specified environment (Ubuntu 22.04). Diagrams must be clear and support learning objectives. Word counts must meet specified targets per module. All content must follow Docusaurus Markdown standards with proper frontmatter.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices for the AI textbook project. All PRs and reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan. All changes must maintain consistency with the Digital Brain → Physical Body theme and purpose. The constitution must be referenced in all major project decisions and PR reviews.
