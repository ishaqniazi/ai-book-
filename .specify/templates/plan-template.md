# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Compliance with AI Textbook Constitution

- ✅ **Theme & Purpose**: Verify project aligns with Digital Brain → Physical Body (Embodied Intelligence) textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
- ✅ **Execution Scope**: Confirm work restricted to textbook content creation (no chatbot development, hardware installation, or ROS/robot automation unless in /specs/features/)
- ✅ **Language Standards**: Ensure code/docs in English, file names in English kebab-case, user responses in Roman Urdu
- ✅ **Organization**: Verify organization by feature/module, max 3-4 nesting levels, clean root
- ✅ **Auto-Creation**: Confirm auto-generation of missing files/folders with proper headers
- ✅ **Course Structure**: Validate alignment with 13-week structure (Module 1: ROS 2, Module 2: Digital Twin, Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac, Module 4: Vision-Language-Action)
- ✅ **Content Requirements**: Verify word counts (15k-20k total), 5+ examples per module, Ubuntu 22.04 compatibility, type hints, English comments
- ✅ **Technical Standards**: Confirm Ubuntu 22.04, ROS 2 Humble/Iron, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- ✅ **Format Standards**: Ensure Docusaurus Markdown with proper frontmatter

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
