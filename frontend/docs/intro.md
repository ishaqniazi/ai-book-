# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This 13-week course will guide you through the fascinating world of embodied intelligence, where digital brains connect with physical bodies to create intelligent, interactive systems.

## The Digital Brain → Physical Body Paradigm

The core concept of this textbook is the transformation from digital intelligence to physical action - from algorithms and neural networks to robots that can perceive, think, and act in the real world. This represents the evolution from traditional AI that exists purely in digital space to Physical AI that bridges the gap between computation and the physical world.

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules that build upon each other:

### Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI (Weeks 1-5)
- Week 1: Foundations of Physical AI
- Week 2: Sensing the World
- Week 3: Motor Control & Action
- Week 4: Perception Pipeline
- Week 5: Digital Twin Concepts

### Module 2: Physical Interaction & Dynamics (Weeks 6-7)
- Week 6: Physics & Interaction Basics
- Week 7: Human-Robot Interaction Basics

### Module 3: Perception & Navigation (Weeks 8-10)
- Week 8: Vision Systems (Conceptual)
- Week 9: Mapping & Understanding Environments
- Week 10: Navigation & Path Planning

### Module 4: Integration & Control (Weeks 11-13)
- Week 11: Kinematics & Movement
- Week 12: Decision-Making for Robots
- Week 13: Full System Overview

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will understand:
- How digital intelligence can be embodied in physical systems
- The fundamental principles of sensing, perception, and action
- How robots interact with the physical world
- The architecture of intelligent robotic systems
- How to think about the integration of all components into a cohesive system

## Approach

This textbook takes a conceptual approach, focusing on understanding the fundamental principles of Physical AI without requiring specific hardware. We'll explore the concepts through diagrams, examples, and thought experiments that help you visualize how these systems work.

Let's begin our journey into the world of embodied intelligence!
